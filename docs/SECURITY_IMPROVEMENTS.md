# Security Improvements for Direct Exposure Setup

## Quick Security Enhancements (Current Setup)

### 1. Restrict IP Access (Immediate - 2 minutes)
Instead of `0.0.0.0/0`, restrict port 8000 to specific IPs:

```bash
# In AWS Security Group, change Custom TCP (8000) rule:
# From: 0.0.0.0/0
# To: Your specific IP addresses or IP ranges
```

**Get your IP:**
```bash
curl https://ipinfo.io/ip
```

### 2. Add Basic Authentication Headers
Update your application to require additional headers:

```python
# Add to your FastAPI app
from fastapi import Header, HTTPException

@app.middleware("http")
async def security_headers(request: Request, call_next):
    # Add security headers to responses
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Content-Type-Options"] = "nosniff"
    response.headers["X-Frame-Options"] = "DENY"
    response.headers["X-XSS-Protection"] = "1; mode=block"
    return response
```

### 3. Environment-specific API Keys
Use different API keys for production:

```python
# In production, use strong, unique API keys
PRODUCTION_API_KEYS = {
    "prod_key_xyz789": {
        "name": "Production Client",
        "rate_limit": "100/minute"
    }
}
```
